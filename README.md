# Fraud-bank-account-Detection
In recent years,Fraud detection & Money Laundering have been the major focus of many financial institutions.It is
the data investigation process by Data Science team & the development of model that will provide the best results in
revealing & preventing suspicious fraudulent accounts using ML Algorithms.

The adaptive framework should be able to learn,adapt & get creative while performing data transaction processing to avoid any misclassification of
non-fraud account.

We have developed an adaptive model based on dataset from NeuralIPS which containing 1M
instances based on a real-world dataset.We have 11029 fraud account details against 988971 non-fraudulent account
details.Since dataset is highly imbalance,it possessed great challenge for data preprocessing,data modeling,feature
extraction, analysis sampling & analytics.We have used algorithms such as Logistic Regression,SVM,Random
Forest & ANN to bulid model.We can deploy this model on any system as webapp to find fraud account.
